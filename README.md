# Unit 3
# Executive Summary

Today we are going to talk about differnt types of software, how to code in another coding language (Python), virtualization, and looking into internships and organizations that can help further your career. 

# Software

* Application Software: Application software is the second major category of software. An example of this type of software is when you are planning a software to meet a specific goal, such as calculations.
* Utility Software: Utility softwares are programs that allow you to fix or modify your computer. An example of utility software is any anti-malware programs, which remove programs you no longer want installed. 
* Operating System Software: An operating system software is first installed by a boot program, but is then used to manage all other programs in the computer, it is required for all computers. An example of an Operating system software would be Mac OS for Apple. 
* ERP Software: The Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Software was made in order to bring an entire organization together within the same program. An example of an ERP software would be a software used by Microsoft in order for the entire organizaiton to complete work together. 
* Virtualizaiton: Virtualization is the process of using a software to simulate a computer. This is when one computer can perform functions of multiple computers. Virtualization is software that makes computing independent of physical infrastructure, while cloud computing delivers shared computing resources.
# Python

Python code is screenshotted and attched to lab folder. 

# Virtualization

* What types of problems are solved with virtualization?
* Performs the funtions that would normally take mulitple virtual computers 
* Reduce the number of physical servers, which reduces the demand for electricity
* What role does hypervisor play in virtualization?
* Hypervisor is on top of the physical hardware and abstracts the machine's resources, which are then made available to virtual environments
# Career Exploration

## Career Exploration

### Tri-C College Central:

My screenshot of the listings can be found in the lab folder. 

### Bureau of Labor Statistics

A screenshot of what appeared when I searched "web developer" on the Bureau of Labor Statistics website is submitted in the lab folder. 
## Industry Certification

CompTIA is an intermediate high stakes cybersecurity certification with a variety of questions. The test gives the candidate an ability to show their skills in not only the way they respond to network findings, but also the software and applicaiton security and other daily work. 

## College Certificates

* .Net Programming certificate: "Post-Degree Professional Certificate in .NET Programming is designed to establish, update or enhance skills in .NET technologies including but not limited to C#, .NET Framework and ASP .NET including database and web technologies." (taken from the Tri-C website)

* In order to become co-op ready I will need to have a clear understanding of developing programs in a higher language (like C#) and be able to troubleshoot and repair program codes. I should also be prepared to be able to expalin the purpose, design, and funcionality of the codes I create. 
## Professional Membership

* I chose to look into the CCDC. The purpose of the organization is to provide a curriculum that can be controlled to assess the depth's of the students understanding in information systems. It would be beneficial to be a member of this organization because it will allow students to have the ability to apply the theory and practice skills they are learning about, but hands on. 
# Conclusion

Throughout this lab, I learned about the many different types of software and how they correlate with each other. I also have an understanding in the difference between virtualization and cloud computing. Learning another type of coding program is also something I learned during this lab. I have a better understanding on how to use the program, Python. I also was able to start a search for local jobs, internships, organizations, and even other certificates in the career path I am pursueing.
